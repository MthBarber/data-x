							Data-X is powering technological advancement through a huge range of information gathering implementations. The data that is harvested from our systems, simulators, calculators and applications is rigourously processed through our network of data centers that are situated around the globe: on every continent, in every major city. The information that is garnered is managed through a multitude of Artificial Intelligence structures and is  administrated into computerised knowledge that we as human users can incorporate into our technologically driven lives and businesses to influence and transform processes, practices and policies.

						<p class="text-dark fs-1 top-3 bot-9">
							Data-X and its ability to process huge data packets, move them through machine learning algorithms and create resultant artificial constructs with default intelligence built in, is playing a leading role in the battle against global warming, climate change and the drive towards Net-Zero. Technology has propelled huge advancements in human progress, but this has resulted in consequences that are potentially castrophic for our planet. Technology can, is and will play an integral part in realising a future for the generations to come, essentially ensuring an equilibrium is reached where addition of emmisions is equal to subtraction of the equivalently realised levels. Multiplications by the masses are divisible amongst the many and future totals are zero.

						<h2 class="fs-4">Knowledge in its base form</h2>
						<p class="text-white fs-1 top-3 bot-9">
							Our systems are recognised for possesing the most sophisticated AI data collection and learning pathways in the world. A brief summary of the process can be explained thus: Substantial layers of information registers are collected, assembled and compiled into a litany of directories, inventories and records. These are sequenced through a succession of index vaults, re-calculated to quantify efficiacy of computational correctness, double re-registered and then time-stamped twice to ensure log results are optimal. This raw data is then converted, sorted and itemised by dual-complimentary relay mechanisms to maximise accuracy and confirm certification of the data. Once this guarantee has been secured then a triple-lock system releases a series of ordered and unordered events that start at commencement and work through a specific series of implementations until conclusion is reached through finalisation. On expiration, a secondary stage receives initiation protocols and launches an establishment phase that is grounded in authentication parameters and therefore deals in verification and corroborative approval. Through cyclical iterations, realisations are logged and incremental awareness nodes are fired simultaneously building layered understanding that, although in essence is termed artificial comprehension, in digitalised reality situations it is regarded as knowledge in its base form.
